His father has agreed to fund a film up to $250,000, so I''m looking for an experienced director to guide him through the process. He will be making all creative decisions, but he will need help and guidance.

His favorite directors are Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, and Stanley Kubrick. Special preference will be given to anyone who has worked with one of these directors in the past.

You will be helping my son solicit a script, pitch the script to his father, and then plan and create the film. I am not in the film industry so please send a proposed weekly salary in your response to this ad. Only experienced directors who include a proposed salary will be considered.

The last thing I recall is paddling for a wave (at Crespi) and the next thing I remember is laying on a stretcher on the beach looking up at EMTs and you guys in wetsuits. I was barely conscious and the ambulance took me to General Hospital''s trauma unit in SF and I was able to go home by 8 pm after x-rays and a CAT scan. I have a concussion but am glad to be alive. I want you to know that I''m OK. My board made it home unscathed. The wetsuit they had to cut off me was old and threadbare. I left a pile of sand in the hospital bed.

The EMT told the nurse that I threw up a bucket of water after you dragged me out of the water (I don''t remember), which tells me that you saved me from drowning. I have rescued people stuck in a rip twice, but when we got to shore they were fine, just shaken. What you three guys did for a stranger and fellow surfer (me) was heroic and you should be insanely proud.

As soon as this headache goes away I hope to see you in the lineup. I usually ride a 9''0 Robert August (white with yellow and blue stripes) and Linda Mar has been my home break for the past 19 years. I would love to thank you in person, and even though I won''t be able to give you a proper Game of Thrones you-saved-my-life-thank-you, I am indebted to you all.

My children and my partner thank you, my family and friends thank you, and surfers everywhere will silently thank you every time I share this story.

On a cold January night you saw my husband swerving all over the road. You followed him while dialing 911. I hadn''t been able to reach him for a few hours and was frantic by the time this happened. He was out driving under the influence. I appreciate you and everything you did for us.

Yes he was drunk, hammered even, and because of your actions he was arrested and charged. (His first ever offense)

Also because of your actions, he didnt cause an accident, he didnt hurt anyone else and he was able to come home to us.

He is now sober. He has been for a few months now. This was a huge wake up call for him, he is deeply remorseful and is still dealing with his actions. It hasn''t been easy but I really believe that your phone call saved his life and possibly the lives of others. I thank God for you every day and that the outcome wasn''t worse.

One of a kind hearse. 472 big block, mechanically perfect from bumper to bumper. Rebuilt motor and transmission. Only about 1,000 miles on the rebuilds. Has 110,840 original miles. All new front end and brakes. All new brake lines and body mounts. New Gangster white wall tires, and New Baby Moon Wheels. New custom made aluminum radiator ($1000.00). AC and Heater works. Headlights, blinkers, and brake lights all work. All windows roll up and down perfectly. Windshield Wipers Work. Runs and drives like a Cadillac should. Purple flames make it an eye catcher everywhere it goes! The back can hold up to 4 kegs :)

The front interior needs a little work. The back is in pretty good condition minus being a little dirty. The back is set up kind of like a limo with two big seats that face each other. You can easily fit 6-7 people in the back and 3 people in front. The back does have a nice sound system, I would recommend changing the CD deck because the aux port broke. It does have some rust spots here and there, but hey, its a 1971. The front door and back door have different keys and the back door will need a new lock. (It still opens and closes normally) It has a small power steering fluid leak (Looks like the hose), and the fuel gauge always shows full. (A new fuel sender will fix that). It could also use a new gas cap. All the expensive stuff has already been done. (Over $10,000 Invested!)

I converted a car to be powered by bicycle. As you can see in the pictures, the engine has been replaced by a bike. The original transmission now has a cassette on it, and it still shifts (1-4, R and 5 are gone). The rest of the car has been stripped down, leaving only the rolling bits, exterior, driver''s seat, brakes, and steering. I think it currently weighs about 900lbs. On the flats it''s easier to pedal than expected-- we biked it up a (tiny) ~12% hill!

The "cargo bike" requires two to operate, one to pedal and one to steer. I have plans to make it single operator by attaching controls to the handlebars, but the project stalled when I moved to SF. The car is in Los Altos Hills.

I figured it''d be a waste to leave this sitting if someone''s weird enough to want to take it to the playa. It is functional, but is certainly not a product, so whoever takes this should be mechanically-brave.

Some other details: the car is a suzuki (taylor) swift, the bike frame is fairly large (fit someone above >5''5"ish), the parking and normal brakes work great, the diff is welded and one axle removed so the bike only powers the driver side wheel, the interior has tons of space and doesn''t leak, the lights should still work (harness is intact), and the car is registered in my name.

In exchange for having the coolest cargo bike/slowest car on the playa, I request that you organize pickup from Los Altos Hills, donate some amount to charity (let me know which one, amount negotiable), and send me pics of it on the desert.
